# ALX Polly: A Polling Application

Welcome to ALX Polly, a full-stack polling application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase. This project serves as a practical learning ground for modern web development concepts, with a special focus on identifying and fixing common security vulnerabilities.

## About the Application

ALX Polly allows authenticated users to create, share, and vote on polls. It's a simple yet powerful application that demonstrates key features of modern web development:

-   **Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login.
-   **Poll Management**: Users can create, view, and delete their own polls.
-   **Voting System**: A straightforward system for casting and viewing votes.
-   **User Dashboard**: A personalized space for users to manage their polls.

The application is built with a modern tech stack:

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Backend & Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)
-   **UI**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
-   **State Management**: React Server Components and Client Components

## üöÄ The Challenge: Security Audit & Remediation

As a developer, writing functional code is only half the battle. Ensuring that the code is secure, robust, and free of vulnerabilities is just as critical. This version of ALX Polly has been intentionally built with several security flaws, providing a real-world scenario for you to practice your security auditing skills.

**Your mission is to act as a security engineer tasked with auditing this codebase.**

### Your Objectives:

1.  **Identify Vulnerabilities**:
    -   Thoroughly review the codebase to find security weaknesses.
    -   Pay close attention to user authentication, data access, and business logic.
    -   Think about how a malicious actor could misuse the application's features.

2.  **Understand the Impact**:
    -   For each vulnerability you find, determine the potential impact.Query your AI assistant about it. What data could be exposed? What unauthorized actions could be performed?

3.  **Propose and Implement Fixes**:
    -   Once a vulnerability is identified, ask your AI assistant to fix it.
    -   Write secure, efficient, and clean code to patch the security holes.
    -   Ensure that your fixes do not break existing functionality for legitimate users.

### Where to Start?

A good security audit involves both static code analysis and dynamic testing. Here‚Äôs a suggested approach:

1.  **Familiarize Yourself with the Code**:
    -   Start with `app/lib/actions/` to understand how the application interacts with the database.
    -   Explore the page routes in the `app/(dashboard)/` directory. How is data displayed and managed?
    -   Look for hidden or undocumented features. Are there any pages not linked in the main UI?

2.  **Use Your AI Assistant**:
    -   This is an open-book test. You are encouraged to use AI tools to help you.
    -   Ask your AI assistant to review snippets of code for security issues.
    -   Describe a feature's behavior to your AI and ask it to identify potential attack vectors.
    -   When you find a vulnerability, ask your AI for the best way to patch it.

## Getting Started

To begin your security audit, you'll need to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) account (the project is pre-configured, but you may need your own for a clean slate).

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd alx-polly
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

The project uses Supabase for its backend. An environment file `.env.local` is needed.Use the keys you created during the Supabase setup process.

### 4. Running the Development Server

Start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Good luck, engineer! This is your chance to step into the shoes of a security professional and make a real impact on the quality and safety of this application. Happy hunting!

## üîí Security Vulnerabilities & Fixes

This section documents the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified during the security audit and the comprehensive fixes that have been implemented.

### üö® Critical Vulnerabilities Found

#### 1. **Input Validation & Sanitization Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Issue**: No input validation on user data, allowing potential SQL injection and XSS attacks
- **Impact**: Data corruption, unauthorized database access, cross-site scripting
- **Location**: All form inputs in authentication and poll creation

#### 2. **Duplicate Vote Prevention Missing**
- **Risk Level**: HIGH  
- **Issue**: Users could vote multiple times on the same poll
- **Impact**: Poll manipulation, inaccurate results, system abuse
- **Location**: Vote submission system

#### 3. **Authorization Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Issue**: Missing ownership verification for poll operations
- **Impact**: Users could delete/modify polls they don't own
- **Location**: Poll deletion and update functions

#### 4. **Client-Side Only Vote Tracking**
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Issue**: Vote state managed only in client-side React state
- **Impact**: Users could bypass voting restrictions by refreshing the page
- **Location**: Poll voting interface

#### 5. **Missing Rate Limiting**
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: No protection against brute force or spam attacks
- **Impact**: DoS attacks, resource exhaustion, system abuse
- **Location**: All server actions

#### 6. **Weak Password Requirements**
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: No password strength validation
- **Impact**: Account compromise, weak authentication
- **Location**: User registration

#### 7. **Insufficient Error Handling**
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Poor error handling could lead to information disclosure
- **Impact**: Information leakage, application crashes
- **Location**: Server actions and API endpoints

### ‚úÖ Security Fixes Implemented

#### 1. **Comprehensive Input Validation**
```typescript
// Strong password requirements
password: z.string()
  .min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters')
  .regex(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]/, 
    'Password must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character')

// Poll question validation with character restrictions
question: z.string()
  .min(1, 'Question is required')
  .max(500, 'Question is too long')
  .regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\?\!\.\,\-]+$/, 'Question contains invalid characters')
```
- **Files**: `lib/validations/auth.ts`, `lib/validations/poll.ts`
- **Protection**: Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and data corruption

#### 2. **Duplicate Vote Prevention**
```typescript
// Check if user has already voted
const { data: existingVote } = await supabase
  .from("votes")
  .select("id")
  .eq("poll_id", validatedData.pollId)
  .eq("user_id", user.id)
  .single();

if (existingVote) {
  return { error: "You have already voted on this poll." };
}
```
- **Files**: `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts`
- **Protection**: Prevents multiple votes per user per poll

#### 3. **Proper Authorization Checks**
```typescript
// Only allow deleting polls owned by the user
const { error } = await supabase
  .from("polls")
  .delete()
  .eq("id", id)
  .eq("user_id", user.id);
```
- **Files**: `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts`
- **Protection**: Ensures users can only modify their own polls

#### 4. **Server-Side Vote Tracking**
- **Implementation**: Moved vote state management from client to server
- **Files**: `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts`
- **Protection**: Prevents client-side manipulation of voting state

#### 5. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
```typescript
// 5 votes per minute per user
const rateLimitResult = rateLimit(rateLimitKey, 5, 60000);
if (!rateLimitResult.success) {
  return { error: "Too many votes. Please wait before voting again." };
}
```
- **Files**: `lib/rate-limit.ts`, `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts`
- **Protection**: Prevents spam and DoS attacks

#### 6. **Strong Password Validation**
- **Requirements**: 8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters
- **Files**: `lib/validations/auth.ts`
- **Protection**: Prevents weak password usage

#### 7. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
```typescript
try {
  // Server action logic
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    return { error: error.message };
  }
  return { error: 'Invalid input data' };
}
```
- **Files**: All server action files
- **Protection**: Prevents information disclosure through errors
